Let's program!
==============

Here I'm collecting some notes and the code from showing a group of children to program by writing a simple game in Haskell. We are using [gloss-game](http://github.com/mchakravarty/gloss-game), a simple wrapper around the Gloss 2D library, to simplify the code. We are using [BigPixel](http://github.com/mchakravarty/BigPixel) to draw the sprites. (There will be an iPad version of BigPixel soon, too!)
