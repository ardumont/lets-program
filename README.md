Let's program!
==============

Here I'm collecting some notes and the code from introducing a group of children to programming by writing a simple game in Haskell. We are using [gloss-game](http://github.com/mchakravarty/gloss-game), a simple wrapper around the Gloss 2D library, to simplify the code. We are using [BigPixel](http://github.com/mchakravarty/BigPixel) to draw the sprites. (There will be an iPad version of BigPixel soon, too!)

So far, we had three coding sessions:

 1. [Step1](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step1): Draw a simple character and move it around.
 2. [Step2](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step2): Add gravity and bound character movement by window edges.
 3. [Step3](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step3): Add a key binding to jump and let the character bounce when it hits the ground.
 4. [Step4](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step4): Properly define constants, such as the window size, and implement continous moving when a movement key keeps being pressed.
 5. [Step5](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step5): Use scenes to describe levels, and add an animation to the character when it jumps.
 6. [Step6](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step6): Add a power up coin and let it super-charge the character.
 7. [Step7](https://github.com/mchakravarty/lets-program/tree/master/step7): Use record syntax throughout for the game state and add a low platform.
